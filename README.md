## **NewsFeed**

## **Introduction**
<p>This app is a clean code architected app.<br>
It provides the top News headlines with a search functionality.<br>
When an article is clicked, a user is routed to a webview of that article<br>
that is read in straight from an API. A floating action button allows the user<br>
to save the article to a local database(ROOM). A tab layout is used to swtich between<br>
the current articles saved, and the latest articles listed. Users can swipe to delete<br>
a saved article in the recycler view, and also undo that action by pressing "Undo" on<br>
the Snackbar that displays.
